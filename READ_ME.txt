This experimet was run on March 2016 - XXXNotes:"On the training EDF file, note that the title is not accurate, the run it begins with with what's written +1"EG MRI_faces_training_run_0_to_2.EDF is actually run 1 to 2."on april 21st, the response to stimuli code was modified to fit the second session. Before that sub 102 & 103 's recall might had a misleading title. Ignore that. "In the second session (1 month followup) the before/after variable should always be 2 (after training)sub 101 - had 2 probe1run1 due to mistake of the MRI technitian - if you find 2 block1run1 - ignore the earlier (it should also be shorter)sub 103 - was very tired and nearly fell asleep both during the original experiment and the 1 month followup. In the followup the first MRI scan of the response to stimuli was incorrect (the slow event related version) delete the data and 85 TR MRI scansub 104 - the MRI headphones did not work well at the 4the MRI run (repetition 7-8 or training) so we stopped and restarted from training 7-8 again
