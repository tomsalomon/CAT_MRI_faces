    % This function is used to create a set of random binary comparisons to be
    % later used in binary_ranking function.
    
    % ---------------- Input ----------------
    % n - number of stimuli.
    % number_of_trials - desired number of unique comparisons.
    
    % ---------------- Output ---------------
    % [list1,list2] - two number_of_trials sized vectors, in which for every i
    % [list1(i),list2(i)] is a unique pair; list1(i)<list2(i).
    
    % These comparisons are all unique - the same comparison may not return
    % more than once. In addition the function will try to make sure each
    % stimulus appears an even amount of time.
    % In case it is not possible to present each stimulus an even amount of
    % times, (e.g. in case the user asked 61 trials with only 60
    % stimuli), the function will not fail, but it will print a warning.
    
    % ================================
    % IMPORTANT NOTE I:
    % Every stimulus will be presented 2*number_of_trials/n times.
    % Therefore, for equal presentation of each stimulus, number_of_trials
    % must be a multiple of n/2.
    %  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    % e.g if n=60, number_of_trials can be 30,60,90,120....
